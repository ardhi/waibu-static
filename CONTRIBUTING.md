# Contributing

Thanks very much to everyone who wants to join as a contributor, but I have committed to devoting 100% of my time to this project. Therefore, I'm currently unable to accept pull requests from anyone until the project is large enough for me to manage it independently.

However, I am available if you encounter any bugs that require immediate fixes. Please report your issues in a GitHub issue, and I'll try to address them promptly. I'm also open to criticism and suggestions for improvements or requests for new features.
